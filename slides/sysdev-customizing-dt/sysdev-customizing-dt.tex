  \frametitle{Customize your board device tree!}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Kernel developers write {\em Device Tree Sources (DTS)},
    which become {\em Device Tree Blobs (DTB)} once compiled.
  \item There is one different Device Tree for each board/platform
    supported by the kernel, available in
    \code{arch/<arch>/boot/dts/<vendor>/<board>.dtb}
    (\code{arch/arm/boot/dts/<board>.dtb} on ARM 32 before Linux 6.5).
  \item As a board user, you may have legitimate needs to customize
    your board device tree:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item To describe external devices attached to non-discoverable
      busses and configure them.
    \item To configure pin muxing: choosing what SoC signals are
      made available on the board external connectors.
      See \url{http://linux.tanzilli.com/} for a web service doing this
      interactively.
    \item To configure some system parameters: flash partitions,
      kernel command line (other ways exist)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
