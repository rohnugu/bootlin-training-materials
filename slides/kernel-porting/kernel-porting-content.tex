\section{Porting the Linux kernel to an ARM board}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Porting the Linux kernel}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The Linux kernel supports a lot of different CPU architectures
  \item Each of them is maintained by a different group of
    contributors
    \begin{itemize}
    \item See the \kfile{MAINTAINERS} file for details
    \end{itemize}
  \item The organization of the source code and the methods to port
    the Linux kernel to a new board are therefore very
    architecture-dependent
    \begin{itemize}
    \item For example, some architectures use the Device Tree, some do
      not.
    \end{itemize}
  \item This presentation is mainly focused on the ARM (32-bit) architecture
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Architecture, CPU and Machine}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item In the source tree, each architecture has its own directory
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \kdir{arch/arm} for the ARM 32-bit architecture
    \item \kdir{arch/arm64} for the ARM 64-bit architecture
    \end{itemize}
  \item The \kdir{arch/arm} directory contains generic ARM code
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \kreldir{arch/arm}{boot}, \kreldir{arch/arm}{common},
      \kreldir{arch/arm}{configs}, \kreldir{arch/arm}{kernel},
      \kreldir{arch/arm}{lib}, \kreldir{arch/arm}{mm},
      \kreldir{arch/arm}{nwfpe}, \kreldir{arch/arm}{vfp},
      \kreldir{arch/arm}{tools} and several others.
    \end{itemize}
  \item And many directories for different SoC families
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \code{mach-*} directories: \kreldir{arch/arm}{mach-pxa} for PXA SoCs,
      \kreldir{arch/arm}{mach-imx} for Freescale iMX SoCs, etc. They
      essentially contain:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item a small SoC description file
      \item power management code
      \item SMP code
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \item Some SoC families share some code, in directories named
    \code{plat-*}
  \item Device Tree source files are in \kdir{arch/arm/boot/dts/<vendor>/}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Before the Device Tree and ARM cleanup}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Until 2011, the ARM architecture wasn't using the Device Tree,
    and a large portion of the SoC support was located in
    \code{arch/arm/mach-<soc>}.
  \item Each board supported by the kernel was associated to an unique
    {\em machine ID}.
  \item The entire list of {\em machine ID} can be downloaded at
    \url{https://www.arm.linux.org.uk/developer/machines/download.php}
    and one could freely register an additional one.
  \item The Linux kernel was defining a {\em machine structure} for
    each board, which associates the {\em machine ID} with a set of
    information and callbacks.
  \item The bootloader had to pass the {\em machine ID} to the kernel
    in a specific ARM register.
  \end{itemize}
  This way, the kernel knew what board it was booting on,
  and which init callbacks it had to execute.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{The Device Tree and the ARM cleanup}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item As the ARM architecture gained significantly in popularity,
    some major refactoring was needed.
  \item First, the Device Tree was introduced on ARM: instead of using
    C code to describe SoCs and boards, a specialized language is
    used.
  \item Second, many driver infrastructures were created to replace
    custom code in \code{arch/arm/mach-<soc>}:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The common clock framework in \kdir{drivers/clk}
    \item The pinctrl subsystem in \kdir{drivers/pinctrl}
    \item The irqchip subsystem in \kdir{drivers/irqchip}
    \item The clocksource subsystem in \kdir{drivers/clocksource}
    \end{itemize}
  \item The amount of code in \code{mach-<soc>} has now significantly
    reduced.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Adding the support for a new ARM board}
  Provided the SoC used on your board is supported by the Linux kernel:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Create a {\em Device Tree} file in \kdir{arch/arm/boot/dts/<vendor>},
    generally named \code{<soc-name>-<board-name>.dts}, and make it
    include the relevant SoC \code{.dtsi} file.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Your Device Tree will describe all the SoC peripherals that
      are enabled, the pin muxing, as well as all the devices on the
      board.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Modify \kfile{arch/arm/boot/dts/<vendor>/Makefile} to make sure your
    Device Tree gets built as a {\em DTB} during the kernel build.
  \item Tweak an existing configuration that matches your SoC and save
    it as \code{<board-name>_defconfig} in \kdir{arch/arm/configs}
  \item If needed, develop the missing device drivers for the devices
    that are on your board outside the SoC.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Understanding the SoC support}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Let's consider another ARM platform here for the kernel side of
    the support: the Marvell Armada 370/XP.
  \item For this platform, the core of the SoC support is located in
    \kdir{arch/arm/mach-mvebu}
  \item The \krelfile{arch/arm/mach-mvebu}{board-v7.c} file (see code on the next slide)
    contains the "{\em entry point}" of the SoC definition, the
    \code{DT_MACHINE_START} .. \code{MACHINE_END} definition:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Defines the list of platform compatible strings that will
      match this platform, in this case
      \code{marvell,armada-370-xp}. This allows the kernel to know
      which \code{DT_MACHINE} structure to use depending on the DTB
      that is passed at boot time.
    \item Defines various callbacks for the platform initialization,
      the most important one being the \code{.init_machine} callback,
      running initialization code for the associated SoC.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

  \frametitle{Components of the minimal SoC support}
  The minimal SoC support consists of
  \footnotesize
  \begin{itemize}
  \item An SoC {\em entry point} file,
    \kfile{arch/arm/mach-mvebu/board-v7.c}
  \item At least one SoC \code{.dtsi} DT and one board \code{.dts} DT,
    in \kdir{arch/arm/boot/dts/<vendor>}
  \item An interrupt controller driver,
    \kfile{drivers/irqchip/irq-armada-370-xp.c}
  \item A timer driver,
    \kfile{drivers/clocksource/timer-armada-370-xp.c}
  \item An earlyprintk implementation to get early messages from the
    console, \kfile{arch/arm/Kconfig.debug} and
    \kdir{arch/arm/include/debug}
  \item A serial port driver in \kdir{drivers/tty/serial}. For Armada
    370/XP, the 8250 driver \kdir{drivers/tty/serial/8250} is used.
  \end{itemize}
  \normalsize
  This allows to boot a minimal system up to user space, using a root
  filesystem in {\em initramfs}.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Extending the minimal SoC support}

  Once the minimal SoC support is in place, the following core
  components should be added:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Support for the clocks. Usually requires some clock drivers,
    as well as DT representations of the clocks. See
    \kdir{drivers/clk/mvebu} for Armada 370/XP clock drivers.
  \item Support for pin muxing, through the {\em pinctrl}
    subsystem. See \kdir{drivers/pinctrl/mvebu} for the Armada 370/XP
    drivers.
  \item Support for GPIOs, through the {\em GPIO} subsystem. See
    \kfile{drivers/gpio/gpio-mvebu.c} for the Armada 370/XP GPIO
    driver.
  \item Support for SMP, through \kstruct{smp_operations}. See
    \kfile{arch/arm/mach-mvebu/platsmp.c}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Adding controller drivers}
  Once the core pieces of the SoC support have been implemented, the
  remaining part is to add drivers for the different hardware blocks:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Ethernet controller driver, in \kfile{drivers/net/ethernet/marvell/mvneta.c}
  \item SATA controller driver, in \kfile{drivers/ata/sata_mv.c}
  \item I2C controller driver, in \kfile{drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-mv64xxx.c}
  \item SPI controller driver, in \kfile{drivers/spi/spi-orion.c}
  \item PCIe controller driver, in \kfile{drivers/pci/controller/pci-mvebu.c}
  \item USB controller driver, in \kfile{drivers/usb/host/ehci-orion.c}
  \item etc.
  \end{itemize}
