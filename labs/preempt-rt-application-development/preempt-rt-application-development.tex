\subchapter{Lab3: Optimizing an application for Real-Time}{}

During this lab, you will:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Better understand the page-faulting mechanism
  \item Debug interferences with a time-sensitive application
\end{itemize}

\section{Compile and run the program}

Compile the crc\_test program: \code{make}

Test the various options, and analyze how the Stack and Heap are allocated and
pre-faulted.

Use ftrace to visualise the page-fault occurings:
\begin{bashinput}
	trace-cmd record -e *page_fault* ./crc_test
\end{bashinput}
